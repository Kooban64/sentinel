- Connected to PostgreSQL, Redis, and Vault
- `.env` and `DATABASE_URL` securely used in containers

### 💻 Frontend Dev Notes
- Frontend successfully deployed on port `4173`
- CORS and access issues known but deferred

## 🧭 Next Steps

### 1. ✅ Git Commit and Push Backup
- Push current system to: `https://github.com/Kooban64/sentinel`

### 2. 🚧 Blockchain Integration (Phase 2)
- Implement proper TX broadcast handling (with error codes, gas estimation, etc.)
- Allow Vault key to sign real tx and send to Alchemy via JSON-RPC

### 3. 🖥️ Admin Dashboard
- Role-based access
- Transaction queues, audit log viewer, Vault sign logs
- Wallet approval thresholds per wallet

### 4. 🔐 Vault Hardening
- Turn off dev mode
- Create proper Vault policies and roles
- Restrict token access by RBAC in future

## 📝 End-User Computing (EUC) Notes

- Vault keys and phrases are never exposed in plaintext
- Signing requires 3 approvals, ensuring fraud resistance
- Audit trail exists for every critical operation
- Only system user (not staff) triggers Vault actions
- Easy to extend with Gnosis SAFE or other multi-sig later
